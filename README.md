# 🥗 MealMaster_App

**MealMaster_App** is a personal project developed during **Build Week at Masai School**. This application is designed to help users plan their meals, track daily nutrition, and stay aligned with their dietary and fitness goals.

As a solo developer, I built this project from scratch using **React**, **Firebase**, and other modern web technologies. It was a hands-on opportunity to apply what I’ve learned at Masai in a real-world, user-focused application.
